# Country Shooter VR for Daydream

### An educational geography game for Daydream VR.

The gameplay is simple - When a country name shows up on the screen, find it and shoot it. You'll be scored on speed and accuracy.

## Getting Started

Some horror stories have convinced me not to use GitHub for prefabs and scenes (yet). This repo is mostly just the `.cs` scripts. Instead of cloning the entire repo, follow these steps.

1. Follow [Google's instructions](https://developers.google.com/vr/develop/unity/get-started-android) for creating a Unity VR project.
2. Download the `country_shooter_vr.unitypackage` from the root of this repo.
3. [Import the package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetPackages.html#ImportingPackages) into Unity
